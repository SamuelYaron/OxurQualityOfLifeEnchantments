# Oxur Quality of Life Enchantments

**This mod is still WIP**

This mod aims at providing some vanilla friendly enchantments that improve the quality of life in Minecraft without
being too powerful. Every enchantment can be enabled or disabled and configured individually.

If you have wishes or ideas for more enchantments to be added to this collection, feel free to make a 
[request](https://github.com/SamuelYaron/OxurQualityOfLifeEnchantments/issues).

## Enchantments

### Veinminer I-III
This enchantment for pickaxes enables the mining of entire veins of ores (connected ore blocks of the same type).
The level determines the maximum amount of blocks that can be mined at once.

**Configuration options**
- veinminerEnabled: Enables the enchantment if True, otherwise disables it.
- veinminerSizeFactor: Used in the calculation of the maximum amount of blocks that can be mined at once.
It is calculated by *enchantment_level * veinminerSizeFactor*

## Roadmap
This are the enchantments I plan to add to the collection. Since my time for modding is limited they will be added
without any specific schedule.
- TreeChopper (Enchanted axe can fell entire trees at once)
- Speed (Enchanted boots increase the movement speed slightly)
- WaterInfinity (Enchanted bucket can pour water endlessly for the cost of XP)
